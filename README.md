# Eki_Wiki
**Description**
I'm trying to figure out how to build a wiki site from [Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) with Windows 10 on my pc!
So this page is a documentation and a log book where I can show you how I proceeded.

I'm going to learn it step by step:

Steps Overview:
1. Browsing the official documentation site
2. Watching tutos
3. Start to documentate what I've learned
4. Buiding things
